"""The decision audit: grade every fp16 decision, not just the safe ones.

`audit_live_rows` — the continuous, always-on check — only ever sees rows the
bound KEPT. Those rows are exact-scored either way, so "N rows audited, zero
violations" is drawn entirely from the decisions where correctness did not
depend on the bound. The rows that were PRUNED, the only place a wrong bound
can lose a result, were never looked at.

`audit_decisions` runs both passes over the whole slice and grades all four
outcomes against exact scores:

    correct_prune   denied, and the slice really held nothing.  Correct.
    FALSE PRUNE     denied, but a candidate was there.          A LOST RESULT.
    correct_live    kept for rerun, and it was needed.          Correct.
    wasted_live     kept for rerun, nothing was there.          Safe, pure cost.

Only `FALSE PRUNE` is a bug. `wasted_live` is what `eps`'s slack costs, and it
is the half of the matrix nothing else in the suite can see.

    """Every admitted capability must have a committed probe result ON DISK.

    Theorem 1 is conditional on (R5). A capability in `_R5_GENERATIONS` that no
    probe has run on is an assumption about silicon we have never touched, and
    the two-pass would prune on it in production. The T4 is why this is not
    paranoia: it measured (8,1) where the published Turing row says (4,0), so
    inheriting a generation from a paper is demonstrably not measuring it.

    The measured set is READ FROM `docs/brute-force/tc-probe/results/*.json`,
    not hardcoded. An earlier version of this test listed the capabilities by
    hand and included (8, 0) and (9, 0) because those runs were expected to
    land -- so it passed while the allowlist carried two generations with no
    evidence behind them, which is precisely the failure it was written to
    catch. A test that restates the intention cannot detect that the intention
    was not met.
